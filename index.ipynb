    "### Background\n",
    "For an absolute beginner, it is often difficult to write even a single line of code that works correctly. Most programming languages are very specific in terms of their syntax. You miss a set of brackets, or a colon/semi-colon or mis-spell a variable name and an error gets thrown back at you. As one moves towards writing non-trivial code in a  professional context, the level of code complexity increases accordingly and it still remains hard to write a few lines of code without tripping over. Identifying and correcting logical / semantic errors in a self-written program is a highly desirable skill for programmers as well as data scientists. \n",

    "In a professional context, debugging code (a process of tracking errors in code) may take more time than actually writing code.\n",

We can set breakpoints to specify the place where our program should stop - a line number, function name or exact address in the program.\n",
